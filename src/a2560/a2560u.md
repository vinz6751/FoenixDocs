# A2560 U
The A2560U was the first Motorola 68000-based Foenix and was designed for Stefany to gain experience on integrating a 68000 before taking up the GenX or A2560K's design. As such, it is very similar to the C256, but with a 68k-family processor. To date, only A2560U+ (with 4MB of RAM) have been built.

Things to know:
* Always write the registers with the length documented in the user manual, otherwize it will not work.
* All addresses for bitmaps, tiles, sprites etc. must be on a bit boundary address corresponding to the bus width (16 on 68000, 32 on 68040).
* Addresses specified to VICKY, e.g. bitmap address etc. must be relative to the video ram. 
* The mouse position registers at $B40C02 are read-only. The mouse position is automatically updated after writting PS/2 mouse packets to the addresses at $B40C0A.
* The UART has 3 wires connected only. RTS/CTS cannot be used.
* The video memory can be written as bytes or words, but not as long words.
* Colour LUTs are write-only.
* The format of colours in Colour LUTs is RrGgAaBb.
* Flash memory bank 0 cannot execute code in user mode, only supervisor. Bank 1 can do both.
* The PS/2 has a fairly low interrupt level. Ensure that other interrupt handlers return quickly so to not loose PS/2 bytes.


Known issues:
* Read-Modify-Write instructions like TAS may not work due to missing signals on the 68SEC000, so the FPGA has problems detecting 16bit vs 32bit operations.
* There are artefacts on the screens when writting the video ram too quickly.
* Possible problem with acknowledging 16750 interrupts. Use its status register instead to detect what cause the interrupt.
* The SD controller may not work on all SD cards. Write your own big-banging code if you need this.
* Mouse clipping may let the mouse move one pixel too much so the mouse may be completely out of the screen.
* The "alternate status" of the IDE controller may not be timely refreshed. You may use the normal "status" register instead. Beware it will acknowledge interrupts but if your not using interrupts.
* The 640x400@70Hz (and 320x200@70Hz) may not work, and after selecting them it's not possible to restore a working resolution without power-cycle.
